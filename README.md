# ahurle-dev

Powers the ahurle.dev website and developer blog. Heavily modified fork of [Devii](https://github.com/colinhacks/devii).

[I wrote a blog post about this project](https://ahurle.dev/blog/overengineering-a-nextjs-dev-blog) if you want some more context on why it exists.

Feel free to fork this repo for your own website! I know how annoying it is to get everything working nicely if you were to start from scratch instead. All I ask is that you style it a little differently - make it "yours". And remove my blog posts and stuff, of course. It would also be nice if you linked back to me, but it's all MIT licensed so... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Getting started

- Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
  and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
  (perhaps [yvm](https://yvm.js.org/docs/overview) too).
- Clone/fork this repo and `cd` into it

```bash
nvm use  # see .nvmrc
yarn install
yarn dev
```

I ran this on node 14.x for a while without problems. At some point it started exploding on `yarn install`. I was able to get around it like so:

```bash
nvm install v15.11.0
nvm use v15.*
vim package.json # change engines -> node to "15.x"
```

Note that vercel does not support node 15.x or higher yet. It will probably also work if you use Rosetta for Node 14 rather than trying to compile it natively for arm64.
