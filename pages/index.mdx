Welcome to my internet website. I'm a full-stack software engineer who loves Ruby, TypeScript, React, and I guess Python is okay too. I also like videogames, dancing, music, and food. My blog posts are mostly technical, but I'll write about other stuff too.

Here I am on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hurle/),
[GitHub](https://github.com/fracture91/),
and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adhurle).
You can also try emailing me at any string at this domain. I may not have time to reply but I appreciate hearing from you.

  First eng hire! Job search slash email marketing (think Indeed, Monster).

- Learned Ruby on Rails very intensely and fell in love with it ❤️

## 2012

- Interned at Mozilla for the summer in Mountain View, CA 🦊

  Fun fact: If you used Firefox around 2013 then you've already seen [some of my work](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=587909)

- Switched from Windows to Ubuntu 🐧

  This made my classes more... _fun_, especially Computer Graphics. I also made [a nasty Python script to sync music to my phone from foobar2000](https://github.com/fracture91/fplsync) running under Wine off my Windows partition.

## 2011

- Created [Distillery](https://github.com/fracture91/Distillery) so I could enumerate shared Steam games ♨️

  Since then, Steam implemented its own limited version of this and there are dedicated websites like [SteamCompanion](https://steamcompanion.com/compare). Looking back, this project was kind of neat because I invented my own janky MVC UI framework pre-React and before Angular was really a thing.

## 2009

- Began studying Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute 📚

  I also worked at the IT Helpdesk and fixed people's computers

- Learned JS to make lots of goofy [userscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) 📜

- Created [IGN++](https://github.com/fracture91/ignpp) ✨

  This was a Firefox/Chrome extension that added _\~Web 2.0 AJAX\~_ to a forum to improve its UX. It had like 400 users at its peak and I was very proud of it. Vanilla JS.

## 2008

- Started my first programming class in high school 🧑‍🏫

  In C++, perhaps the worst language to start with

- Implemented games like Conway's Game of Life, Snake, Pong 🕹️

  I also ported pong to run on my hacked PSP 🤙

- Did a few challenges on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) 🧩

- Learned Flash in a high school class, and got good at Photoshop 📸

  Maybe copy/pasting some ActionScript was my first exposure to code

## ~1999-2004

- Played a lot of StarCraft and Unreal (Tournament) 🖱️

  I remember creating custom StarCraft maps and messing around in Unreal's dev console

## ~1998

- First home computer 🖥️

  My favorite pastimes were [Kid Pix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4zH2if0kU) and printing out pages of [webdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webdings)

## ~1997

- First time on the internet thanks to [WebTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_TV) 📺

  I used it to listen to the soundtrack from Back To The Future

## ~1995

- First gaming console - a Sony PlayStation 🎮

  I remember playing on a NES, SNES, Genesis, and Macintosh, but this was the first one that my family owned.
  [Ridge Racer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMTPYVWnTTU&list=PL5MAATZlrqOhGQ6trLJ-iFCg2_TrGuEOU&index=1),
  [WipEout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUQxO8ZFU9g&list=PLsPMOz2-mpmPVQVxqhIU31jzmlD5-osq4&index=1),
  and later [THPS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S51HkasuvdQ&list=PLB3FnBA-48BED8VsTro4T0-emKTPWI7iK&index=1)
  massively influenced my taste in music.
